	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>DonorHub is an online platform for people who want to donate blood and hospitals that want to apply to receive blood donations. Each registered hospital has a password which they must enter to apply for the blood deliveries, making the platform secure. The need for blood donations in Africa is drastic. We decided to help solve this problem in third-world countries. We wanted to do this in an efficient manner, so we decided to create a website that would enable blood donrors to be managed efficiently.</p>
